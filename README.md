# factory_simulation
Program which simulates manufacturing of parts and final products by factory workers using C++ multi threading facilities

Consider a plant, where there are m part workers (each will be implemented with a thread) whose jobs
are to produce four types of parts (A, B, C, D). Each part worker will produce 4 pieces of part of any type
combination, such as (3,0,1,0), (2,0,1,1), (1,1,1,1), etc., given that it takes 50, 70, 90, 110 microseconds
(us) to make each part of type A, B, C, D, respectively. For example, it takes a part worker 50*2 +110*2
us to make a (2,0,0,2) part combination. Each part worker will attempt to load the produced parts to a
buffer area, which has a capacity for 6, 5, 4, 3 pieces of type A, B, C, D parts, respectively. That is, the
buffer capacity is (6,5,4,3). It will take a part worker 20, 30, 40, 50 us to move a part of type A, B, C, D,
respectively, to the buffer. Each part combination, such as (1,1,1,1) is referred to as a load order.
The current number of parts of each type in the buffer, such as (6,2,1,3) is referred to as buffer state. A
part worker will load the number of parts of each type to the buffer, restricted by the bufferâ€™s capacity
of each type. For example, if a load order is (1,1,1,1) and the buffer state is (6,2,1,3), then the part
worker can place a type B part, and a type C part to the buffer; thus, the updated load order will be
(1,0,0,1) and the updated buffer state will be (6,3,2,3). The part worker will wait near the buffer area for
the buffer space to become available to complete the load order. A wait time of 3000 us will make a
part worker stop waiting. When this timeout event occurs, the part worker will check if the buffer
allows the load order to complete. If yes, the part work will complete the load order and finish this
current iteration. If the buffer cannot allow the load order to complete, the part worker will discard the
remaining, unloaded parts. Assume that it takes the same move time for each type of parts to discard.
Recall that it takes a part worker 20, 30, 40, 50 us to move a part of type A, B, C, D, respectively. The part
worker then ends the current iteration. A part worker will then repeat the process to produce a brandnew load order.


In addition, there are n product workers (each implemented as a thread) whose jobs are to take the
parts from the buffer area and assemble them into products. Each product assembly needs five pieces
of parts each time; however, the five pieces will be from exactly three types of parts, such as (1,2,2,0),
(1,3,1,0), (1,1,0,3), (0,2,2,1), etc. with equal occurrence probability. For example, a product worker will
not generate a order of (1,1,2,1), (3,2,0,0), etc. Each such legal combination from a product worker is
referred to as a pickup order. The time it takes a product worker to move a part of type A, B, C, D from
the buffer is 20, 30 40, 50 us, respectively. Like that for part workers, partial fulfillment policy is
adopted. If the current buffer state is (4,0,2,1) and a pickup order is (1,1, 0,3), then the updated buffer
state will be (3,0,2,0) and the updated pickup order will be (0,1,0,2). The product worker will wait next
to the buffer area, looking to complete the pickup order. Once all needed parts are obtained, they will
be moved back to assembly area and then assembled into products. The move time for parts of each
type has been described. The assembly time needed for parts of type A, B, C, D, will be 80, 100, 120,
140, respectively. If the wait time reaches 6000 us, the product worker will stop waiting. The product
worker will check if the buffer allows the pickup order to complete. If yes, the product worker will move
all parts back and proceed to the product assembly work. After the required assembly time, the product
worker then ends the current iteration. If the buffer cannot allow the pickup order to complete, then
the product worker will give up the pickup order and discard the parts that have been picked up. The
time to discard is the same as the time to move as described above. The current iteration then ends.
The product worker will then re-produce a brand-new pickup order.


Centralized locking mechanism with notifications is used to develop a simulation of the activity of the
above-described plant. Notifications are designed to improve the performance of the plant,
while ensuring a fair treatment to all workers. Each part work or product worker is said to have
completed one iteration when a load order or pickup order is completed, or if timeout event occurs
such that an order is aborted. Your program should allow each worker to finish 5 iterations.
Every time when a part worker thread or a product worker thread gain the access to the shared resource, a log entry is created in a file call log.txt . Total number of products manufactured is printed on console at the end of the program.
